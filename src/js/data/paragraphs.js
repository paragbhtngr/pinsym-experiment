He enjoys the Xylophone, jackpot 777, animal sound, milking and matching cards games. After every game, chat with him. Give him lots of encouragement.",

He loves to dicuss the game while he is playing it. It would be best for you to respond to his conversation. He do also enjoy bowling game. And during the game, he might also talk to you about his past experience in playing the game real life. And lastly, do make sure to respond fully and give him encouragement when he requires it.",

      "comment": "Firstly the resident was not willing to cooperate with me. She keep telling me she cannot understand the application and hse inot able to do it. I did show her a few application to win her over. After some time she started to talk. Recommendation: Need a demo of the tool to explain the user wha tthey will be getting into. The application should have different language for them to be comfortable.",

      "comment": "The resident was uncomfortable with the fact that everything was in English and using the tablet. When talking to her I found out that she was more comfortable speaking Cantonese as she told me when I asked her to chitchat if I could speak Cantonese. Although she is uncooperative, you need to be patient and assure her that she can play the games. After demoing the game and explaining how to play it you can try encouraging her to play along with you. Hold her hand and lead her on how to play (do this for a few rounds); after that let her play to explore the games on her own. Although she might be claiming that she does not know how to play the games, she did not really say that she did not like the game that I was playing with her. The game that I spent the most time with her was polar bowl and I got her to play it for only a while after constant reassurance that she can play it cheering her on every time she bowls.",

She loves to cook and thinks there's no difficult dishes to prepare. She has Sri Lankan heritage, was born in Malaysia, moved to Singapore because of her father and has a daughter in England or USA who works in the infirmary (?) and loves animals. her daughter's birthday is today 08 April and she is really committed to getting on a call with her, possibly very close to her daughter (?). She used to sing with a band at a Naval Base in Sembawang, a German song, and she loves Jazz. She almost visited New Orleans and thinks it was a \"wasted\" opportunity that she didn't. //She didn't enjoy playing the coloring game and got bored of the repetitive Ice Cream Uncle game. The hit the cans game was the most engaging for her and she really enjoyed seeing the cans fall because of her attempts. However, she got bored of it after a while as well, and we reverted to making conversation.",

Her father did business in Singapore and brought his family over, the later applied for SG citizenship. She remembers the games she enjoyed (tablet game) which was the ball shooting game into the cans. She often asked for lunch. According to Gladys she has 2 daughters and 1 son.",

      "comment": "Resident likes to play with the cat. He enjoys petting and hitting the cat. He doesn't talk much but is reactive to games that allows very frequent interaction. He likes playing basketball too, but keeps preseeing on exit. He generally likes playing with the tablet and doesn't have much preference. I played a few games like plant, piano, etc. He won't react much because there isn't much to do. Straight forward games, instead of level-ish.",

      "comment": "The resident does not like to engage much in talking. He seems to require people to guide him along with the exercise and requires people to give a demonstration on the way the game is being played. Following which, he will follow in the way you do it. He also does not seemt o dare to break the boundaries, as I showed him an example of me drawing and just kept repeating what I did. But he particularly enjoys playing puzzle games and those games with sounds. As he enjoys the music from the games and he also seems to have a sense of achievement after he managed to complete a puzzle.",

      "comment": "I feel that the person I was tasked to handle was not easy. This was due to the fact that she could only speak in her own dialect, she could not speak English and not much of Chinese. However, this can be countered by using apps with drawings and colours. She will follow your lead, whatever you draw, she follows, which is good. // She however, cannot comprehend the more complex apps which can be troublesome at times as it limits the options you have with her. She constantly says she doesn't understand things, what to do and how to do as she is uneducated, in her own words. Motivation is thus required with her, and you must lead by example. Be the leader that you are born to be :)",

      "comment": "I feel that interaction with this client is a challenging task, especially because she only knows her own dialect (hokkien). During the period when I was interacting with her, she doesn't seem very interested in the tablet games, however, she would play along. Due to the fact that she does not understand English, explaining the games in the tablet is not very useful. However, you are able to lead by example and show her how it is played. You would have to constantly explain or talk to her or else she would lose interest.",

      "comment": "Even though one of her languages is Mandarin, it'll be best to sepak with her in Hokkien instead. Most of the time she's not intereste din the activity and would prefer interactions in Hokkien. // As she is not interested in the activity, she will tell you that she wants to leave. It'll be best not to ignore her, and reassure her that the session is ending, as she is going to repeat her message until you reply her. For the games, she prefers colouring games in general and is not interested in games involving music (piano, etc). Overall it's better to focus on the interaction with her than the tablet activity itself!",

      "comment": "The client doesn't talk much. Try not to repeat the same games over and over again as there will not be any surprising element anymore. Also, some games require a certain amount of time to wait, by the time the waiting time is over, the client lost her interest already. It will (be) best if you can play the same game until she lost interest, then move on to another game that interests her. She does not touch or use the tablet, so you wil have to swipe/touch for her. She is a very visual and hearing person, usually games with a lot of graphics & musics will keep her interested for quite long.",

She may not really answer much questions, however, she will nod in agreement or smile at times. She also does not touch or use the tablet but when encouraged she would try to use the tablet and play (try to guide her hands by holding her hands at times if she is not comfortable). She likes to play the polar bear bowling game if you guide and help her.",
